<h1 align="center">MIT Graduate Eye Tracker </h1>

<p align="center">
This is a two in one project I combined. The first project is an eye tracker I coded. Its a pair of eyes that follow the cursor wherever the point goes. The next, is a string of letters that follow the cursor where it goes. As you move the cursor around, the full string "MIT Graduate" reveals itself!
